# Nasa Image Search

## Building the app
The app builds using [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/). An executable wrapper for Gradle is provided within the codebase (`gradlew` and `gradlew.bat`), so you don't need to install Gradle locally to build the app.

To clean build:

`./gradlew clean assembledevDebug`


To build and install the debug version on the connected device just invoke the gradle wrapper script from the root project folder:

    ./gradlew clean installdevDebug


## Project Structure
The project is organized using MVVM pattern. The project contain One main modules:

- **`app`** all the Android related code resides here
    - `src/main/java` code shared between all the build variants
    - `src/main/res` contains the assets packaged within the app
    - `src/test/java` unit tests for the code in the `app/src/main`


## Code Structure
The main data models used are:
- **`model`**: Which is POJO class with similar keys and structure as backend API JSON response.
    - Gson is responsible for converting JSON data to ApiModels.
    - Eg: `ImageDetails.kt.`
- **`ViewStateModel`**: Which has all data needed to display the view in the screen.
    - It holds the final data values
    - It hold information like color, text with proper properties and visibility information of the views.
    - it avoid business logic, so we can make it simple to use when binding each time.
    - We use custom kotlin converter classes for this conversion. Eg: `NewsListViewStateConverter.kt`
    - Eg: `ImageListViewState.kt`
- **`**NasaBackend.kt:`**
    - Retrofit Interface class for backend API.
    - API path will be defined here.
    - Eg: `NasaBackend.kt`
- **`**Fetcher.kt:`**
    - Fetcher responsible for initializing the retrofit client and Moshi JSON converter.
    - It hit the backend API and get the JSON response and convert to model
    - Eg: `NasaApiFetcher.kt`
- **`**Repository.kt:`**
    - Repository is responsible for composing the backend fetcher and convert it into ViewState in background thread.
    - It helps to manage/convert the data `BestSellerBooksViewStateConverter`.
    - Handle creating different states like loading, idle and errors.
    - Eg: `NasaImageRepository.kt`
- **`**ViewModel.kt:`**
    - Responsible to present the view in mobile.
    - `Activity` communicate with `ViewModel` to initiate all the process above.
    - ViewModel would be activity lifecycle aware.
    - Eg: `DisplayImageViewModel.kt`
